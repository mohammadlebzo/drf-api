### Project: drf-api

### Author: Mohammad Lebzo

### How to run:

In order to run the server on local system enter "**python .\manage.py runserver**".

In order to run the server using Docker just run "**docker-compose up**" after navigating to the project directory.

In order to access the api data navigate to "**/api/v1/games/**", which would give you a list of all the data available, 
and if you want to access a specific item just enter the id of it at the end.
